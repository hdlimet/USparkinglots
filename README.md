**Analysis for the warming effects of parking lots across U.S. cities**

Overview:
The analysis includes two part derive from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and R 4.3.3 platform.   
GEE is a cloud-based service that provides access to satellite imagery and geospatial datasets for planetary-scale analysis. Raw data can be retrieved from GEE, and the associated scripts for data processing are available in the three links: <br />

The GEE codes correspond to the R code with the same ID. The output of GEE code is the input for the statistical analysis using R 4.3.3.
\. 

The input data for R is avaiable in the folder "input". The R codes are avaiable in the folder "code".
